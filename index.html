            Hi, my name's Ard Scheirlynck and I'd like to welcome you to my homepage! I'm a developer, geek and
            self-proclaimed inventor living in Gullegem, Belgium.
            In my daily work I develop backend applications for internal customers in a high-tech company. You could say
            I'm a bit of jack of all trades; analysing, developing,
            deploying, documenting; they all sound familiar to me. Feel free to take a look on my page and send me a
            DM if you'd like to drink a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è!
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            In my spare time I like going on a hike with my dog Nalu üê∂. Next to that I like to
            play basketball, cycling and running.
            Gaming is also a big passion of mine. I'm therefore happy and proud to say I'm an editor for
            <a href="www.9lives.be">9lives.be</a>, Benelux' largest gaming website. Besides all that, I also like
            experimenting with Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, Artifical Intelligence and other cool
            technologies. I'll try to keep the projects page updated to give you a view on what I'm currently working
            on.
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            Kindly yours,
            Ard
