            Hi, my name's Ard Scheirlynck and I'd like to welcome you to my homepage! I'm a developer, geek and
            self-proclaimed inventor living in Gullegem, Belgium.
            In my day to day work I develop backend services for internal customers in a high-tech company. You could
            say
            I'm a bit of jack of all trades; analysing, developing, testing, deploying, documenting; they all sound
            familiar to me.
            Feel free to take a look on my page and slide into my DM's if you'd like to drink a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è!
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            In my spare time I like going on a hike with my dog Nalu üê∂. Next to that, I'm also a quite sporty guy.
            Basketball,
            cycling and running are some of the sports I do on a weekly basis.
            Gaming is also a big passion of mine. I'm therefore happy and proud to say I'm an editor for
            <a href="https://pragalicious.com">pragalicious.be</a>. Besides all that, I also like
            experimenting with Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, Artifical Intelligence and 3D printing...
            As you can see I'm quite an eager beaver, so forgive me if my site isn't always up to date.
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            Kindly yours,
