                Hi, my name's Ard Scheirlynck and I'd like to welcome you to my homepage! I'm a developer, geek and
                self-proclaimed inventor living in Gullegem, Belgium.
                In my daily work I develop backend applications for our internal customers at Melexis. You could say I'm
                a bit of Jack of all trades; analyzing, developing,
                deploying, documenting all sound familiar to me. Feel free to take a look on this page and send me a DM
                if you'd like to drink a coffee with me ‚òïÔ∏è!
            </p>
            <p class="lead regular-text">
                In my spare time I like spending time with my dog Nalu üê∂ and going for a hike. Next to that I like to
                play basketball, cycling and running.
                Gaming is also a big passion of mine. I'm therefore happy and proud to say I'm an editor for
                <a href="www.9lives.be">9lives.be</a>, Benelux' largest gaming website. Besides all that, I also like
                experimenting
                with Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, AI's and all other kind of buzzwords. I'll try to keep the projects page
                updated to
                give you a view on what I'm currently working on.
            </p>
