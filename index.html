                Hi, my name's Ard Scheirlynck and I'm a developer living in Gullegem, Belgium. I'd like to welcome you
                at my homepage!
                I mainly develop web apps and back-end applications at Melexis. I do this in a variety of programming
                languages but that often boils down to java, kotlin and python.
                Things like AI, CI/CD, docker, kubernetes, gcp do also sound familiar to me.
            </p>
            <p class="lead regular-text">
                In my spare time I like spending time with my dog Nalu üê∂ and going for a hike. Next to that I like to
                play basketball, cycling and running.
                Gaming is also a big passion of mine. I'm therefore happy and proud to say I'm an editor for
                <a href="www.9lives.be">9lives.be</a>,
                Benelux' largest gaming website.
            </p>
