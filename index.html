            Hi, my name's Ard Scheirlynck and I'd like to welcome you to my homepage! I'm a developer, geek and
            self-proclaimed inventor living in Gullegem, Belgium.
            In my daily work I develop backend applications for our internal customers at Melexis. You could say I'm
            a bit of Jack of all trades; analysing, developing,
            deploying, documenting all sound familiar to me. Feel free to take a look on this page and send me a DM
            if you'd like to drink a coffee with me ☕️!
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            In my spare time I like spending time with my dog Nalu 🐶 and going for a hike. Next to that I like to
            play basketball, cycling and running.
            Gaming is also a big passion of mine. I'm therefore happy and proud to say I'm an editor for
            <a href="www.9lives.be">9lives.be</a>, Benelux' largest gaming website. Besides all that, I also like
            experimenting
            with Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, AI's and all other kind of buzzwords. I'll try to keep the projects page
            updated to
            give you a view on what I'm currently working on.
        </p>
        <p class="lead regular-text">
            Kindly yours,
            Ard
