## Introduction

In the summer of '18 we decided to buy a dog. Our little friend (a.k.a. Nalu) would arrive in September, meaning summer holidays we're over and we'd be back to work.  
During his first days, I was able to take some days off to keep an eye on him. However after a week his first he had to spent his first day 'home alone'.

I'd wanted to keep an eye open on my little friend when I was at work, so I bought a Raspberry Pi, a PiCam a Servo-arm and started hacking something together.
