## Introduction

Why hiring a photobooth if you can make your own? 

I forked the reuterbal/photobooth repository and started implementing my own extra features: [https://github.com/ardtieboy/photobooth](https://github.com/ardtieboy/photobooth). Photos are kept in memory and are uploaded to a GCP bucket and indexed in a firestore database.
A website was built as well to present the photos to the user instead of printing them.

The photobooth has been used multiple times already and is a great succes!

A special thanks goes out to Brecht, Morgane and Jurgen for helping me realizing this project!
