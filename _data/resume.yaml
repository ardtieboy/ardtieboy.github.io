    description: "First of all I like doing sports; therefore I play competitive basketball at BBC
    Gullegem. Next to that I like running and cycling. Also I enjoy spending time with my dog; both making long walks and doing some obedience training. 
    Furthermore; gaming is a passion of mine. I can	enjoy spending some	hours in the virtual world. A few years back I was able to combine this hobby
    with another passion of mine, which is writing, at 9lives.be. Finally I like reading up and learning about tech and electronics."
